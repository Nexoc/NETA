### 13. Analyze the HTTP request  
**What method is used, who is the sender, and what is the full URL?**

**Answer:**  
A typical HTTP request from a client looks like this:

```

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0

```

**Key elements:**
- **Method:** The action requested → e.g., `GET`
- **Sender:** Always the **client** (e.g., browser, curl) initiates the request
- **Full URL:** Combine `Host` + `Path` → `http://www.example.com/index.html`

> 📌 In HTTP/1.1, the `Host` header is mandatory.  
> The full URL is reconstructed using: scheme + host + path

### 14. Explain 3 HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT)

**Answer:**  
HTTP defines several **methods** (also called **verbs**) to perform actions on web resources:

| Method | Purpose                      | Example use case                     |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | Retrieve a resource          | Load a webpage or image              |
| POST   | Submit data to a server      | Login form, comment submission       |
| PUT    | Upload or replace a resource | Update a user's profile via REST API |

**Other common methods:**
- `DELETE` — remove a resource  
- `HEAD` — like GET but no response body (used for checks)  
- `OPTIONS` — ask server which methods are supported

> 📌 GET and POST are the most commonly used by browsers.

### 15. What is the structure of an HTTP request?  
**Which headers are required?**

**Answer:**  
Structure of a basic **HTTP/1.1** request:

```

METHOD /path HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html

(request body for POST/PUT)

```

**Important headers:**

| Header        | Purpose                                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Host          | Required in HTTP/1.1 to identify domain             |
| User-Agent    | Identifies the browser/client                       |
| Accept        | Indicates preferred response formats                |
| Content-Type  | Required if body is present (e.g., POST with JSON)  |

> 📌 The request always starts from the **client** and follows the **HTTP protocol over TCP**, usually port 80 or 443 (HTTPS).
